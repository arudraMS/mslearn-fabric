### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

In this lab, you will mirror data in a lakehouse using Fabric Mirroring  by connecting to your data source, develop direct lake reporting using Power BI service and Power BI Desktop.

## Lab objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

	- Connect to the Data Warehouse  
	- Mirror the following Databases
		* Snowflake
		* Azure SQL
		* Cosmos
		* Databricks
   	- Running queries using Notebook in Fabric Lakehouse to extract insight
	- Running queries using TSQL in Fabric SQL Endpoint to extract insight
        - Build Semantic Models from Mirrored Databases using Fabric SQL Endpoint
	- Build Direct Lake Reports using Power BI service & Power BI Desktop
	- Collaborate on Findings
  


## Summary
In this lab, you developed mirrored databases, ran queries to extract insights from those databases using Fabric SQL Endpoint as well as notebooks Fabric SQL Endpoint or a Fabric data warehouse or using Fabric Copilot and explored the available datasets. You ran queries visualizations for effective analysis. Finally, you compiled your findings into reports and collaborated with team members on the results.
